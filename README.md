***Ask your real-world questions or be an Open Advice Agony Aunt!***

We are building a website providing Agony Aunt style advice to people who want to work openly but currently find themselves in a closed environment.  We aim to help early career researchers do their best to be open even if they find that their supervisor doesn't support this goal. You don't have to wait until you are the boss!

The website was created by [Kirstie](https://github.com/KirstieJane) and [Danielle](https://github.com/daniellecrobinson) in preparation for [OpenCon 2016](http://www.opencon2016.org/). They launched the project during an [unconference](http://www.opencon2016.org/unconference) session and are excited to continue to develop the project going forwards.

### Goals

* Collect information and anecdotes that will help researchers interested in openness start where they are.

* Collect stories of people who have moved from working in traditional closed workflow to working openly.

* Gather practical advice - what can a person can do when they can't follow ideal practices of openness?

* Gather links to resources and blogs.

* Get a conversation going between people with expertise in data sharing / working openly and researchers in the field who face barriers to openness (for example, people who do not have ownership of their data).

* If you've never made a GitHub website, join us to collaborate and we will show you!
