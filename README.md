# OpenAdvice
A website providing agony aunt style advice to people who want to work openly but currently find themselves in a closed enviroment.

This website was created by Kirstie and Danielle in preparation for OpenCon 2016.

We aim to help early career researchers do their best to be open even if they find that their supervisor doesn't support this goal.
