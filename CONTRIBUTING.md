# Contributing to Open Advice

Welcome to the Open Advice project [GitHub repository][link_openadvicerepo], and thank you for thinking about contributing! :smiley::heart::smiley:

The point of this file is to make it suuuuuper easy for you to get involved. So if you have any questions that aren't covered here please let us know! Check out the [Share your thoughts](#share-your-thoughts) section below for more details.

Before you start you'll need to set up a free [GitHub][link_github] account and sign in. Here are some [instructions][link_signupinstructions].

Scroll down or jump to one of the following sections:

* [Share your thoughts](#share-your-thoughts)
* [Make a change](#make-a-change)
* [Recognising contributions](#recognising-contributions)
* [Get in touch](#how-to-get-in-touch)

## Share your thoughts

Although GitHub calls them **issues**, we'd like you to think of them as **conversation starters**. They're our way of communicating across all the members of the team.

(If you're here you ***already are*** a member of the Open Advice team.)

Your thoughts can be [suggested questions][link_suggestedquestion], [contributor questions][link_contributorquestion], [bugs][link_bugs], [requests][link_requests] or a myriad of other suggestions. In the next section we'll talk through some of the labels on each issue to help you select the ones you'd most like to help with.

One thing to note: It's always nice to get some positive feedback or community support for an issue. If you want to just agree with everything in an issue you can [react to the post][link_react] with one of :+1: :laugh: :heart: :tada:. 

If you're looking for more information, GitHub has a nice set of help pages about [discussing projects using issues][link_discussingissues].

### Labels

You can find all currently open conversations under the [issues tab][link_issues].

The current list of labels are [here][link_labels] and include:

* [![Suggested questions](https://img.shields.io/badge/-suggested%20question-d4c5f9.svg)][link_suggestedquestion] These issues are questions you (or others you know) have about working openly. These are the point of the project!

    To ***post a question***, set the title of a new issue with the word `QUESTION: ` and then a short (5-10 word) summary of the question. For example: `QUESTION: Supervisor doesn't support open data sharing`
        
    Then add in the text of your question in the issue itself.
    
     **THANK YOU!** You're adding to our database of questions! YOU. ROCK. :clap: :sunglasses:
    
    To ***suggest an answer***, just add your response to the issue as a comment.
    
    You're also welcome to ask for clarification for a question or suggest a different way of phrasing it.
    
<br>

* [![Contributor questions](https://img.shields.io/badge/-contributor%20question-cc317c.svg)][link_contributorquestion] These issues are questions you have about the project.

    Before you ask your question please read the project's [README.md](https://github.com/KirstieJane/OpenAdvice/blob/master/README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/KirstieJane/OpenAdvice/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) files. You might find your answer in there.

    If we haven't covered them, then please open a new issue and add your question. We're super excited to hear from you!
    
    ***Please feel free to reply to the questions if you know the answer!*** You don't have to wait for one of the project owners to answer!
    
    You can also use our [Gitter channel][link_gitter] to ask and answer questions.
    
<br>

* [![Good First Bug](https://img.shields.io/badge/-good%20first%20bug-5319e7.svg)][link_goodfirstbug] These issues contain a task that anyone with any level of experience can help with.
    
    A major goal of the project is to have as many people as possible complete their very first [pull request][link_pullrequest] on one of these issues. They will always have explicit information on who to contact to help you through the process.
  
    Remember: **There are no stupid questions!**
    
    We can not encourage you enough to submit even the tiniest change to the project repository. Let's go from :confused: & :anguished: to :smiley: & :tada: together!

<br>

* [![Help Wanted](https://img.shields.io/badge/-help%20wanted-159818.svg)][link_helpwanted] These issues contain a task that a member of the team has determined we need additional help with.

    If you have particular skills then consider reading through these issues as they are a great place to offer your expertise.
    
    If you aren't sure what to offer, you could also recommend issues to your friends/colleagues who may be able to help.
    
<br>

* [![Bugs](https://img.shields.io/badge/-bug-ee0701.svg)][link_bug] These issues point to problems in the project.

    If you find a bug, please give as much detail as possible in your issue.
    
    If you experience the same bug as one already listed, please add any additional information that you have as a comment.

<br>

* [![Requests](https://img.shields.io/badge/-request-fbca04.svg)][link_request] These issues are asking for features (or anything else) to be added to the project.

    If you have a good idea and would like to see it implemented in the STEMM Role Models project please open a new issue and add in as much detail as possible.
    
    Please try to make sure that your feature is distinct from any others that have already been requested or implemented. If you find one that's similar but there are subtle differences please reference the other request in your issue.

<br>

* [![Web development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-web%20dev-bfdadc.svg)][link_webdev] These issues relate to the development of the actual website.

    These issues are likely to be asking for help from experts in [front end development][link_frontenddev_wiki], so the HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript for the website.
    
    
## Make a change

Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository! :tada::smiley:

1. First, describe what you're planning to do as a comment to the issue, (and this might mean making a new issue).

    Check in with a couple of other members of the Open Advice team to ensure you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.
    
    [This blog][link_pushpullblog] is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.
    
2. [Fork][link_fork] the [Open Advice repository][link_openadvicerepo] to your profile.

    You can now do whatever you want with this copy of the project. You won't mess up anyone else's work so you're super safe.

3. Make the changes you've discussed.

    Try to keep the changes focused rather than changing lots of things at once. If you feel tempted to branch out then please *literally* branch out: create [separate branches][link_branches] for different updates to make the next step much easier!

4. Submit a [pull request][link_pullrequest].
    
    A member of the executive team will review your changes, have a bit of discussion and hopefully merge them in!

**Success!!** :balloon::balloon::balloon: Well done! And thank you :smiley::tada::sparkles:

## Recognising contributions

If you're logged into GitHub you can see everyone who has contributed to the repository via our [live contributors page][link_contributorslive]. (You might have to add `KirstieJane/OpenAdvice` as the repository name before you click to sign in via GitHub.)

This page is powered by the [Let's all build a hat rack][link_hatrackhome] project, and we love them. 

Quoting from their [website][link_hatrackhome]:

> Open Source project contribution focuses a lot on the code committed to projects, but there is so much more that goes on behind the scenes that is just as valuable to FOSS than the code itself.
> 
> LABHR seeks to find those that provide these non-code contributions, and thank them. 
>
> LABHR started as an [idea by Leslie Hawthorn][link_hatrackidea]. She advocates openly thanking people on social media, and writing recommendations.
>
> This idea was extended by Katie McLaughlin with her work on [automating this process on GitHub][link_hatrackcontributions]. 

## How to get in touch

If you have a question or a comment we'd love for you to [open an issue][link_issues] because that will be our fastest way of communicating, getting the answers to you and (if necessary) making a change.

If you'd prefer to email the founders you can contact [Kirstie](https://github.com/KirstieJane) at kw401 AT cam DOT ac DOT uk or [Danielle](https://github.com/DanielleCRobinson). They're [Mozilla Fellows for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows) and can sometimes be a little busy, so please be gentle in your correspondence and give them a couple of days to reply. If you don't hear anything before or during Kirstie's regular "office hours" on Monday afternoons please feel free to ping her again.

## Thank you!

You are awesome. :heart_eyes::sparkles::sunny:
