title: My boss is determined to publish in a paywalled journal. Is there anything I can do to make my paper available?
---

Here are some things you can do:

Please discuss self-archiving with your boss! You can archive your work either on your personal website, in a repository at your institution or another repository.

Read the licensing agreement of the journal where your boss wants to publish. Find out if your university has an institutional repository where you can deposit your article in a proof-form (without the journal's formatting, then you can link to this on your personal website.

Most reputable journals allow for the self-archiving of postprints or preprints in repositories. Search [SHERPA/RoMEO](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/) for the journal title and see what the journal allows for self-archiving. Explain the [benefits](http://f1000research.com/articles/5-632/v3) of making a version of the article Open Access, which includes potentially increased citations and attention for your paper as well as providing access to a version of your results for those who do not have subscriptions to the journal. These benefits can be particularly helpful for Early Career Researchers and increased attention can help you advance your career (which will make your boss look good too) while still adhering to your boss's requirement to publish in the paywalled journal.
