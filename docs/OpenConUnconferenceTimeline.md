### Format of the in-person session Nov 13, 2016, an Unconference Workshop at OpenCon 2016 in Washington DC

* 3:15 - Get a coffee and join us [add location]

* 3:30 - Introductions and session goals (see below)

   Facilitators: Kirstie & Danielle

   Attendee introductions

* 4:30 - Editing website together

* 5:30 - Publish the site!

### Goals

1. Collect information and anecdotes that will help researchers interested in openness start where they are.
  
2. Collect stories of people who have moved from working in traditional closed workflow to working openly.

3. Gather practical advice - what can a person can do when they can't follow ideal practices of openness?

4. Gather links to resources and blogs.

5. Get a conversation going between people with expertise in data sharing / working openly and researchers in the field who face barriers to openness (for example, people who do not have ownership of their data).

6. If you've never made a GitHub website, join us to collaborate and we will show you!

### Example Questions

* Danielle can't share data or images from scientific talks containing unpublished data, but she can share her general audience talks on GitHub or FigShare (and in the process learn to use tools that will facilitate later open practices).

* Suzanne's boss is determined to submit their paper to a closed access journal, but Suzanne can check the journal's liscening agreement and can probably post an unformatted draft on her personal website or insitutional repository. (This also works when you realize you've been publishing closed access for years - post the unformatted drafts!)
